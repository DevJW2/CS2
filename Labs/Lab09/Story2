Look, I didn't want to be a NOUN. If you're VERB this because you VERB you might be one, my advice is: VERB the NOUN right now. VERB whatever lie your NOUN or NOUN VERB you about your NOUN, and try to VERB a ADJECTIVE NOUN. Being a NOUN is ADJECTIVE. It's ADJECTIVE. Most of the time, it gets you VERB in ADJECTIVE, ADJECTIVE ways. If you're a ADJECTIVE NOUN, VERB this because you think its NOUN, great. VERB on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. But if you recognize yourself in these NOUNs if you feel something VERB inside stop VERB immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they VERB it too, and they'll VERB for you. Don't say I didn't VERB you. My NOUN is Percy Jackson.
