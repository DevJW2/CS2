Bilbo was very ADJECTIVE and very ADJECTIVE, and had been the wonder of the NOUN for sixty years, ever since his ADJECTIVE disappearance and ADJECTIVE return. The NOUNs he had VERB back from his VERBs had now become a local NOUN, and it was ADJECTIVE VERB, whatever the old folk might say, that the NOUN at NOUN was full of NOUNs VERB with NOUN. And if that was not enough for NOUN, there was also his ADJECTIVE ADJECTIVE to VERB at. NOUN wore on, but it seemed to have ADJECTIVE NOUN on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to VERB him well-ADJECTIVE; but ADJECTIVE would have been nearer the NOUN. There were some that VERB their NOUNs and VERB this was too much of a ADJECTIVE NOUN; it seemed ADJECTIVE that anyone should VERB (apparently) perpetual NOUN as well as (reputedly) ADJECTIVE NOUN.
